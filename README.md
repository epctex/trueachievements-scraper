# Actor - TrueAchievements Scraper

## TrueAchievements scraper

Since TrueAchievements doesn't provide a good and free API, this actor should help you to retrieve data from it.

The TrueAchievements data scraper supports the following features:

-   Search any keywords - You can search any keyword you would like to have and get the results of game, articles and all comments!

-   Scrape article list pages - Get all articles, comments and all the content.

-   Scrape series detail - Retrieve all games of any series.

-   Scrape games of a publisher - Scrape all the games from specific publisher(s).

-   Scrape XBOX game pass list - Get all the list of games on XBOX game pass.

-   Scrape game list - Scrape full XBOX games list from TrueAchievements.

-   Scrape genres - If you want to get games on a certain category or anything related the genres, just type the url.

-   Scrape game detail - Images, sizes, achievements, developers, genres, publishers and many more information can be retrieved for each game that you'd like to get.

-   Scrape article detail - All content of any article and its comments are ready for you.

## Bugs, fixes, updates and changelog

This scraper is under active development. If you have any feature requests you can create an issue from [here](https://github.com/epctex/trueachievements-scraper/issues).


## Input Parameters

The input of this scraper should be JSON containing the list of pages on TrueAchievements that should be visited. Possible fields are:

- `search`: (Optional) (String) Keyword that you want to search on TrueAchievements.

- `startUrls`: (Optional) (Array) List of TrueAchievements URLs. You should only provide news list, search, any listing URL, game detail, article detail, genre detail, publisher detail URLs.

- `includeComments`: (Optional) (Boolean) This will add all the comments that TrueAchievements provides inside the article object. Please keep in mind that the time and resources the actor uses will increase proportionally by the number of comments.

- `endPage`: (Optional) (Number) Final number of page that you want to scrape. Default is `Infinite`. This is applies to all `search` request and `startUrls` individually.

- `maxItems`: (Optional) (Number) You can limit scraped items. This should be useful when you search through the big lists or search results.

- `proxy`: (Required) (Proxy Object) Proxy configuration.

- `extendOutputFunction`: (Optional) (String) Function that takes a JQuery handle ($) as argument and returns object with data.

- `customMapFunction`: (Optional) (String) Function that takes each objects handle as argument and returns object with executing the function.

This solution requires the use of **Proxy servers**, either your own proxy servers or you can use [Apify Proxy](https://www.apify.com/docs/proxy).

### Tip

When you want to have a scrape over a specific list URL, just copy and paste the link as one of the **startUrl**.

If you would like to scrape only the first page of a list then put the link for the page and have the `endPage` as 1.

With the last approach that explained above you can also fetch any interval of pages. If you provide the 5th page of a list and define the `endPage` parameter as 6 then you'll have the 5th and 6th pages only.

### Compute Unit Consumption

The actor optimized to run blazing fast and scrape as many items as possible. Therefore, it forefronts all detail requests. If actor doesn't block very often it'll scrape 100 data points in 2 minutes with ~0.06-0.09 compute units.

### TrueAchievements Scraper Input example

```json
{
  "startUrls":[
    "https://www.trueachievements.com/news?search=game",
    "https://www.trueachievements.com/n52218/way-to-the-woods-game-pass",
    "https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Monster-Energy-Supercross-4",
    "https://www.trueachievements.com/xbox-series",
    "https://www.trueachievements.com/series/Call-of-Duty?distinct=true&dlcsetting=AllDLC",
    "https://www.trueachievements.com/publisher/Electronic-Arts/games",
    "https://www.trueachievements.com/xbox-game-pass/games",
    "https://www.trueachievements.com/games.aspx",
    "https://www.trueachievements.com/genre/Simulation-Racing",
    "https://www.trueachievements.com/searchresults.aspx?search=game"
  ],
  "search":"last",
  "maxItems":20,
  "endPage": 1,
  "includeComments":false,
  "proxy":{
    "useApifyProxy":true
  }
}

```

## During the Run

During the run, the actor will output messages letting you know what is going on. Each message always contains a short label specifying which page from the provided list is currently specified.
When items are loaded from the page, you should see a message about this event with a loaded item count and total item count for each page.

If you provide incorrect input to the actor, it will immediately stop with failure state and output an explanation of what is wrong.

## TrueAchievements Export

During the run, the actor stores results into a dataset. Each item is a separate item in the dataset.

You can manage the results in any languague (Python, PHP, Node JS/NPM). See the FAQ or <a href="https://www.apify.com/docs/api" target="blank">our API reference</a> to learn more about getting results from this TrueAchievements actor.
